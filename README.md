Twilio TimeZone Bookmarklet
=========================

Have you ever been annoyed that Twilio's log screen displays times in PDT only?

We rely heavily on Twilio at OpenRent - and sometimes using their logs can be useful. Using the time in GMT is extra handy.

This bookmarklet will convert the times to local time.

Go here to install the bookmarklet.

Obviously - this could break at any time if twilio change their log screens.
